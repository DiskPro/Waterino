# Waterino

## What is it?
A timed plant-watering system that sends humidity information via Bluetooth to the cellphone of the user.

## TODO
* Add a way to change watering intervals based on relative air humidity

## Other stuff
Installing [Bluetooth Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=Qwerty.BluetoothTerminal&hl=en) is heavily recommended. It provides you with lots of debugging information and makes testing changes on the go easier.
